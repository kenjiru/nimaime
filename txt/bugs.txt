Major bugs
==========
Drag and drop related:
- clicking with the right mouse button on an image, selects the image for drag 
  and drop 
* scrolling the file list causes drag and drop to handle incorrectly images
* moving the mouse cursor slowly while dragging can create a trash clone of 
  the file
* moving scrolled files in Opera

Uploading related:
- when timeout occurs application stalls (use statechanged)
* when there is an error the application stalls

Properties change:
- IE doesn't accept getting and setting of new properties 
  solution: use alt and title

Design:
* extra padding for the form element in IE
