Major bugs
==========
Drag and drop:
- clicking with the right mouse button on an image, selects the image for drag 
  and drop 
* scrolling the file list causes drag and drop to handle incorrectly images
* moving the mouse cursor slowly while dragging can create a trash clone of 
  the file
* Opera: moving files while FileList is scrooled

Uploading:
- client side: extensions check to be case unsensitive
- client side: check if any files selected for upload before submiting
- when timeout occurs application stalls 
  solution: use statechanged
* when there is an error the application stalls

Listing files:
* problem when the extension is uppercase

Properties change:
- IE: doesn't accept getting and setting of new properties; 
  solution: use alt and title

Design:
* IE: extra padding for the form element
