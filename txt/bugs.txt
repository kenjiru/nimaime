Major bugs
==========
Drag and drop related:
- clicking with the right mouse button on an image, selects the image for drag 
  and drop 
* scrolling the file list causes drag and drop to handle incorrectly images
* moving the mouse cursor slowly while dragging can create a trash clone of 
  the file
* Opera: moving files while FileList is scrooled

Uploading related:
- when timeout occurs application stalls 
  solution: use statechanged
* when there is an error the application stalls

Properties change:
- IE: doesn't accept getting and setting of new properties; 
  solution: use alt and title

Design:
* IE: extra padding for the form element

Improvements
============
Drag and drop related:
- the dragging copy always offsets down and left
