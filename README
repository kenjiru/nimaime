What is it?
===========
Nimaime is a simple JavaScript upload manager.

Installation
============
Just copy the folder somewhere on the server.

Configuration
=============
Before running the application you have to edit the file 
	'includes/config.inc.php'

1. Specify the upload path which contains the upload folders. Do this by 
editing the variable $root_dir. 

2. Next you have to define the upload folders and the extensions associated 
with each folder. Only the folders specified in this variable will be 
used by the application.

The variable should look like this:

$allowed_dirs = array("Images" => ".jpg .jpeg .png",
	"Movies" => ".flv");

There are 2 folders:
* "Images", which allows files with the extensions .jpg, .jpeg and .png
* "Movies", which allows files with the extension .flv

3. Create the actual upload folder to which is pointing the variable $root_dir 
and give it read/write permissions.

The individual upload folders will be created automatically based on the 
$allowed_dirs variable.
